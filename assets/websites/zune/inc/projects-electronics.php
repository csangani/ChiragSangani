Modern day electronics is very different from the world of resistors and capacitors that any introductory course to electronics
introduces to its audience. Academics has a history of being slow to accept and 
imbibe changes, and electronics has been just that: rapid advances made in a 
short period of half a century. Almost 60 years ago, computers were invented. 
They were huge computers, took the space of entire rooms and consumed 
electricity equivalent to a small town. Today, computers a thousand times more 
powerful can run off solar power and store enough for the night, while being so 
tiny so as to be virtually invisible.</p>

These advances are but for nought if the new generation is not able to embrace 
it. As a member, and later a coordinator of the Electronics Club at the Indian 
Institute of Technology Kanpur, I have always been intrigued by the multitude of 
gadgets today. Their abundance clearly implies that electronics is not something 
complicated, but rather simple and, more importantly, fun to work with. As such, 
I have made multiple projects based on different types of electronics.</p>

My first exposure to electronics came at IIT Kanpur itself. I started out by 
knowing what an IC is and how to use it, and ended up designing them myself 
(through FPGAs). The projects listed here are the ones I undertook during my 
walk on the path of this learning.</p>
