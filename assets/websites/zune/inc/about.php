		Nicknamed &quot;The Zune Design,&quot; this website is heavily based upon the Metro 
		UI used by Microsoft for its Zune Media Player and Windows Phone 7. Deep 
		backgrounds, slick visuals and clean Sans-Serif typography adorn this minimalistic 
		design language.
		<p>The purpose of this website is to maintain a repository of my works in 
		a manner that is easily accessible to not just me but anybody who is potentially 
		interested. For a writer, a blog would have sufficed; but my diverse interests 
		prevented me from accomodating them all inside a blog format.</p>
		<p>I make my best attempt to keep the information in this website updated 
		and accurate, but errors may creep in. In case any piece of information 
		is vital to you and it seems erroneous / you wish to make sure it is updated, 
		feel free to <a onclick="loadContent('contact',false);">contact</a> me.
		</p>
		<p>The website has been designed using Microsoft Expression Web 4 and Adobe 
		Photoshop CS5. Further details are available in the
		<a href="<?php include_once("config.php"); ?>creativity/websites/ZuneDesign">
		Creativity</a> section.</p>

		not agree with the terms of the disclaimer then you must leave this website
