<p>During my time at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, I have undertaken 
multiple projects in the fields of electronics and computers. I do not consider 
the websites that I design as projects simply because they are the expression of 
my creativity. </p>
<p>Many of these projects relate to different spheres of technology. As such, a 
basic level of knowledge is required to make use of them. Wherever possible, I have 
tried to provide as many links as possible to websites that might help you understand 
the topic of the project or the technologies used in it. Though I have added as 
much information as I could about the project itself, feel free to contact me for 
any further details about them.</p>
<p>Note that none of these projects have been extensively tested - they are not 
the equivalent of production software or industrially-designed hardware solutions. 
As such, any data is provided &quot;as is&quot; and I bear no responsibility on any outcome 
of having used any information provided here. Usage of the code is entirely at your 
own risk. On this note, please read the disclaimer before continuing.</p>
