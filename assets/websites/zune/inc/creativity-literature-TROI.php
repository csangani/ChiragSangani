	... It would seem, then, that we are masters of crafting illusions in our own reality. 
	And so we are. It is when the illusion breaks, when an unstoppable moment of

	us are so blinded that we can never see this moment of clarity except through 
	our tinted glasses that keep us safe inside the merry world we make for ourselves. 
	And through those glasses, the moment seems dull and uninteresting at the very 
	best, and offensive, at the very worst. It seems like a blasphemy, a crime 
	against the reality we have constructed for ourselves and we violently react 
	to it, reject it and fight it tooth-and-nail. We fail to recognize that we 
	no longer control the illusion we created for ourselves - it controls us, we 
	are nothing without it; for, to remove the illusion after such a long dependence 
	would be to strip ourselves bare naked to a world of sharp needles ready to 
	prick our assumptions and make them bleed until there are none left and we are 
	left with nothing - shameful, riddled with paradoxes and confused. No, we would 
	rather keep our illusions...</blockquote>
