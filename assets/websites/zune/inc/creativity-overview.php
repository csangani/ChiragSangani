<p>This place is dedicated to the outcomes of the right side of my brain, if indeed 
it is the origin of creativity. Since long I have had a fascination for art, and 
while my lack of skill with the brush hindered me initially, the marvels of technology 
once again came to my rescue. Since then, I have regularly attempted to express 
myself in terms of images rather than words, though, in the above case, the image 
is not necessarily mine.</p>
<p>A fork of my interest in art, website design came to me when I was 13, for which 
I owe my gratitude to my cousin for having introduced it to me. Beautiful, interactive 
websites have always been something of a fascination, and I relish the discovery 
of every single such beautiful site. With my skills in Photoshop and HTML, I have 
attempted to pay homage to this esoteric art.</p>
<p>Finally, literature, or rather, the creation of it, is something that I rarely 
indulge in - the effort that a single essay requires far outweighs the effort a 
single image requires, though the gratification in the former case is immensely 
more satisfying. As part of my curriculum in IIT Kanpur, I have completed a couple of
course in the study of literature - the outcomes of these courses have been
catalogued here.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Mercedes-Benz for this wonderful piece of art.</p>
