<p>I began designing websites when I was 13 using hard-coded HTML. The first website 
I made was <a href="http://aoefire.8m.com/" target="_blank">AoE Fire</a>, a fansite for Age of
Empires fans, which is still online, though mostly defunct. Since then, there has been no looking back.
While most designs happen to be projects for other people, such as <a href="http://www.rajeshsangani.com/" target="_blank">my father's law firm website</a>,
website design for me remains a hobby at the core, and I treat it as such.</p>
<p>Here, I have archived and catalogued some of my best designs. While most of them have 
been inspired by another website or design, they are all made from scratch and hard-coded in HTML, CSS and javascript 
- right down to the images and divs. Information about individual websites is 
provided in its respective page.</p>
