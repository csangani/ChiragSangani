	&quot;Life without an obsession is merely existential.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>I am an undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering 
at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, currently in the third year of my 
Bachelor of Technology programme.</p>
<p>I grew up in the friendly suburban areas of Andheri in the metropolis of Mumbai. 
Since an early stage in my childhood I was exposed to the world of technology, at 
a time when mainstream computing had yet just begun to become popular in India. 
My father holds a membership in the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India 
and is a practicing lawyer. My mother holds a Masters degree in English Literature.
</p>
<p>With such a triumvirate of backgrounds, I grew up to hold interests in diverse 
fields, ranging from electronics and computer science to modern art, dystopian literature 
and progressive music. Many of my hobbies tend to merge these vistas, such as web 
design which brings together efficient programming and artistic imagery.</p>
<p>My major hobbies include electronics, web design, digital design, programming 
and reading or writing various kinds of literature. Examples of my works can be 
found throughout this site.</p>
<p>As quoted above, life, in my opinion, is hollow without a passion: I do not enjoy 
the nihilistic opinion of life. I believe that every action we do should have a 
meaning, a higher purpose. As Danah Zohar, author of

&quot;Spiritual Capital: Wealth We Can Live By&quot;</a> would say, one needs to respond to 
his or her higher calling. As such, I consider it as my calling to give back to 
the world of technology as much as, or more than, what I have obtained and learned 
from it. My ambition is to obtain a post-doctoral degree in computer science, particularly 
related to computer hardware technology and systems, from a reputed university from 
around the world. Following this, I wish to work upon and improve the technology 
that enables the push forward into the information age that man has engaged in since 
the day he created a spark and lit a fire.</p>
<p>I invite you to take a look around and view my various works while enjoying the 
visual delight that I have tried to achieve with this website.</p>
