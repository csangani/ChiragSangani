<p>I did my early schooling at the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan&#39;s A. H. Wadia High School. 
Located in the idyllic campus of Bhavan&#39;s College, Andheri which stands out of the 
metropolitan bustle like an oasis in a desert, it is a well equipped institution 
recognised by the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary Education. I secured 90.93% 
in my high school board exams, the highest in my institute.</p>
<p>My senior secondary education was obtained in the city of Kota from the Central 
Academy Sr. Sec. School, Dadabari. Here, I spent two years preparing for my board 
exams as well as for the Joint Entrance Examination which allowed admittance to 
the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology. I secured 92.2% in my senior secondary 
boards, the second highest from my institute.</p>
<p>Admission to the Indian Institue of Technology Kanpur marked my entry into 
undergraduate studies. Having achieved a high rank of 96 out of almost 3,75,000 
students that appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination, I was able to select 
the Bachelor of Technology programme in the Department of Computer Science and 
Engineering.</p>
<p>At IITK, I have taken interest in multiple topics. Primary amongst these are 
Computer Organization and Architecture, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, 
Principles of Programming Languages, Appreciation of Art and Literature and the 
effect of Literature on the Individual. These topics form the core basis for my 
interests which I intend to build upon further.</p>
<p>On the 20th of March, 2010, I was awarded a Certificate of Merit for academic 
excellence in the Bachelor of Technology Programme in Computer Science and 
Engineering, 2008-09.</p>
