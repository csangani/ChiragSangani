<p>The people at <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> 
happen to be immensely talented - this is amply demonstrated in their beautiful 
art-like games. This talent is visible even in their website: a clean design 
capable of emphasizing images whilst retaining simplicity as well as 
readibility. The Electronics Club website is based directly off this website in 
terms of design, though the code is entirely original. <a href="http://www.wallbase.cc" target="_blank">Wallbase.cc</a> continues to 
be an excellent source for all types of backgrounds and wallpapers, and has 
supplied the background for this website.</p>
<p>Funny trivia: The website implements a wholly custom form of Google Instant 
Search, and was completed just one week before Google announced its own version.</p>
<p>Please note that some features of the website might not work.</p>
