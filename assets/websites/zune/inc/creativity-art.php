<p>Adobe Photoshop is a powerful tool, in that it provides wingless birds the ability to fly. Always artistically inclined, and yet lacking skill with the brush, Photoshop, and later, DAZ 3D Bryce, enabled me to express my creativity in a concrete manner. My skills with both these softwares are self-learnt, acquired over years of tinkering around - a habit brought over from my interest in other fields. 
I now regularly use Adobe Photoshop, and now, even other software, such as 
Bryce, InDesign, etc., to improve the aesthetic appeal of whatever I create - be 
it a poster, a website, or a magazine. But more importantly, creating a 
landscape gives me a mode of expression that, perhaps, even words would fail.</p>
