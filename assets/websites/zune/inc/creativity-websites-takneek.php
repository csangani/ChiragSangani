<h3>Takneek</h3>

<p>Takneek is the intra-college science and technology competition of IIT Kanpur. 
For this website, I desired a design which was futuristic, artistic, 
and one that conveyed a sense of clean, simplistic sophistication. Inspired by the 
glassy theme &quot;Refraction&quot; by the brilliant guys over at
<a href="http://www.rockettheme.com" target="_blank">RocketTheme.com</a>, the website 
of Takneek was completely designed first in Photoshop and then meticulously converted 
into optimum HTML code by hand. The drop-down menu is a third-party script based 
on MooTools that is, alas, broken on Internet Explorer 9. This theme of Takneek 
has been recycled and utilized for 3 years in a row now for the same competition.</p>
<p>Please note that some features of the website might not work.</p>
