					&quot;People are lonely because they build walls instead of bridges.&quot;</blockquote>
				</center>
				<p>Colossal, magnificent, gigantic, prodigious, humongous, gargantuan... 
				Do these words ring a bell? Ever felt awestruck to see these huge
				<strong>bridges</strong> designed with dexterity and care? Ever 
				felt like making one?! Well, here&#39;s a chance for you to transfer 
				your innovativeness and technical skills into a physical model of 
				bridge!! Yes, your very own bridge, designed, fabricated and assembled 
				solely by you!</p>
				<p>Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur and Nirmaan team 
				presents before the folks - <strong>Popsicle Bridge Design Challenge</strong> 
				in TAKNEEK &#39;09.</p>
				<p>Now it is the time for the brilliant and hard-core engineering 
				minds to work and earn few more points for their Pool.</p>
				<h4>Registration and Schedule</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Send a mail to <a href="mailto:msanjay@iitk.ac.in">msanjay@iitk.ac.in</a> 
					or <a href="mailto:kartikey@iitk.ac.in">kartikey@iitk.ac.in</a> 
					with subject &quot;Nirmaan - Registration&quot;. The mail should contain 
					your name of your Pool and team members.</li>
					<li><strong>Deadline for registration is 2359 Hrs, Friday, 18th 
					September.</strong></li>
					<li>The event will start on Saturday, 19th September at 9:00 
					pm.</li>
					<li>All the registered teams must submit their completed bridges 
					in STRUCTURAL LAB by 9:45 pm</li>
					<li><strong>The Final Judging of the event is scheduled at 10.30 
					am, Sunday 20th Sept in the STRUCTURAL LAB.</strong></li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
				<p>Design a three dimensional self-supporting model bridge. The 
				physical constraints of the bridge are according to the following 
				specifications:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Span(S): 500 mm</li>
					<li>Height (H): 80 mm (greater than or equal to)</li>
					<li>Width (W): 120 mm (greater than or equal to)</li>
					<li>Weight: 350 gm (maximum)</li>
					<li>No part of the deck should be more than 50 mm above the 
					abutments (support level).</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Building material</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>POPSICLE STICKS - 270 grams (to each team)</li>
					<li>EPOXY FEVICOL MR - 85 grams (to each team)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Each team will also be provided with a Jewelers hack saw and 
				sand paper.</p>
				<p>All the material will be provided to the POOL SI-TECH SECYS on 
				Friday (19th September 09. The registered teams can get their material 
				from them.</p>
				<h4>Rules and Regulations</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Each Pool can send maximum of 5 teams.</li>
					<li>Each team can have 3 to 5 members. (minimum 3 and maximum 
					5)</li>
					<li>Each team is required to submit the design (drawing, the 
					plane view and the deck view). The deadline for design submission 
					is 6:00 pm, Saturday,19th Sept.</li>
					<li>There are points for aesthetics and originality as well.</li>
					<li>The whole structure is to be constructed in the allotted 
					time only.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Fabrication Specifications</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The whole bridge must be fabricated by using provided materials 
					only; use of any additional material is strictly not allowed.</li>
					<li>The model will be made from Popsicle sticks and joining 
					them by epoxy, however you can use cellophane tape or threads 
					for keeping sticks, etc., in place temporarily.</li>
					<li>You can combine the popsicle sticks as per your design by 
					gluing them together.</li>
					<li>The cellophane tape must not be part of the final structure.</li>
					<li>There should be an adequate gap in between the deck members, 
					for a V-bolt to pass through for loading purpose.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Loading and Testing</h4>
				<p>Testing will take place in the STRUCTURAL LAB on 10:30 am Sunday, 
				20th Sept</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Loading by Screw-Jack.</li>
					<li>Load measurement by Load-cell.</li>
					<li>Deflection measurement by LVDT (Linear variable differential 
					transformer).</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Judging Criterion</h4>
				<p>The bridge will be evaluated for its strength as failure load 
				to self-weight ratio (i.e., structural efficiency).</p>
				<p>Failure load is defined as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Maximum load carried by the bridge before it fractures.</li>
					<li>Load corresponding to 25 mm deflection under the load.</li>
				</ul>
